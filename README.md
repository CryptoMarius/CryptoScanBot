Crypto SBM Scanner for Binance.

The Crypto scanner was initially only intended to generate oversold signals on the Binance exchange (because someone said something about DYOR and you shouldn't say that to a programmer). In the meantime, the application has been turned over a number of times, split, reassembled the best points, improved, simplified and recently adapted for the generation of SBM signals.

The purpose of this application is to generate 3 types of signals called STOBB, SBM (including SBM2 and SBM3) signals. These signals can be used to enter the crypto market on predetermined conditions. With all these signals, only certain conditions have occurred, so always validate the conditions yourself before you get in somewhere. This is mainly because the PSAR can be calculated in a different way by TV and the SBM spaces between the MAs always have to be interpreted by a human.

The application currently only supports the Binance exchange. Other exchanges are currently not supported and are not planned. The application is built in a mix of English and Dutch, because a number of tools have been combined (please indicate whether any texts are disturbing and/or should be adjusted). Apologies in advance for all English crypto terms, for an explanation you have to be on the internet or ask in a crypto group what it means (but always do your own research first).

STOBB (Oversold on Stochastic, Bollinger bands)

SBM (STOBB + 3 Ma lines in the right order + PSAR)
