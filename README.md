CryptoScanBot for Binance Spot, Binance Futures, Bybit Spot, ByBit Futures, Kucoin Spot and Mexc Spot

The Crypto scanner was initially only intended to generate oversold signals on the Binance exchange (because someone said something about DYOR and you shouldn't say that to a programmer). In the meantime, the application has been overhauled a number of times, split, merged the best points, improved, simplified, adapted for SBM signals and made multi-exchange.

The purpose of this application is to generate 3 types of signals (STOBB, SBM and JUMP). These signals can be used to enter the crypto market on predetermined conditions. With all these signals, only certain conditions have occurred, always validate the market and currency conditions before you get in anything. In particular, the PSAR is calculated differently by TradinView and the SBM lines always have to be interpreted by a human.

In latest editions we also try to show dominant zones and FVG *see chart form).

The application currently supports Binance and Bybit spot and Futures. Kucoin is still under investigation but is currently plagued by technical issues. The application is built in a mix of English and Dutch, because a number of tools have been combined (please indicate whether any texts are disturbing and/or should be adjusted), so apologies in advance for English crypto terms, for an explanation you have to be on the internet or ask in a crypto group what it means (but always do your own research first).

Furthermore: Very nice that you try this application, below is an explanation of what the application does, the installation, necessary settings and so on. I hope you enjoy trading, the communities and so on. Good luck in this special world!
